    <p><b>Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with dry, scaly skin. They come in many shapes and sizes and are often quiet and slow-moving, but some can be fast and strong. <br>Reptiles include animals like snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. Most reptiles lay eggs, but some give birth to live young. They live in many places around the worldâ€”deserts, <br>forests, swamps, and even cities. Reptiles love warm places because their bodies <br>need heat from the sun to stay active. They eat different things depending on the species, like insects, plants, or small animals. Reptiles do not have fur or feathers, <br>and many can blend into their surroundings using camouflage. <br>Some reptiles live alone and only come together to mate. Others, like turtles, can live for many years. Reptiles are an important part of nature and help control the number of insects and small animals. <br>They are strong survivors and have been on Earth for millions of years.</b></p>
