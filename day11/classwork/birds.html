    <p><b>Birds are animals with feathers, wings, and beaks. <br>They come in many different sizes, shapes, and colors. Some birds are very big, like eagles and ostriches, while others are tiny, like hummingbirds. <br>Most birds can fly, but some, like penguins and ostriches, cannot. All birds lay eggs, usually in nests they build in trees, on the ground, or even on buildings. Birds live all <br>over the worldâ€”in forests, deserts, mountains, and cities. <br>They eat many different things, like seeds, insects, fish, or meat, depending on the type of bird. <br>Birds use songs, calls, and body movements to talk to each other. Some birds live alone, while others travel in flocks. Many birds migrate, flying long distances during certain seasons to find food or warmer weather. <br>Birds are an important part of nature and help by spreading seeds and eating pests. They make the world more colorful and full of beautiful sounds.</b></p>
