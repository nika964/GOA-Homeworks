        <p><b>Animals are living creatures that can move, eat, grow, and feel. <br>They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. Some animals are big, like elephants and whales, while others are very small, like ants and mice. All animals need food and water to live. <br>They can live in many placesâ€”on land, in water, in trees, or even underground. Some animals have fur, others have scales, and some have smooth skin. <br>Animals can be fast like cheetahs or slow like turtles. Many animals live alone, but some live in groups like herds, packs, or colonies. They use sounds, movements, and smells to talk to each other. <br>Animals are a very important part of nature because they help keep the world in balance. They can be wild or live with people as pets. Every animal has a special role in nature.</b></p>
